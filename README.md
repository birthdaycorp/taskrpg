# TaskRPG

## what is TaskRPG?
TaskRPG is a "tomato timer" based task management system. The goal is quick and easy to-do list management with a built in timer, all on one page.

This app was built with Django, Bootstrap, JQuery, and AngularJS. Tasks are bound by user, and persistent between logins.

## Demo
[Click here for a demo hosted on Heroku](https://murmuring-woodland-70294.herokuapp.com/).

You'll be able to register a username/pw and then get started! Enter tasks on the bottom, click start, and get to work! You'll receive a browser notification once your time is up, then you get a 5 minute break. Repeat until work is done.

## How to Manage time
[This app is loosely based on the pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). When it's crunch time and I'm staring at a huge to-do list, one of the best ways I've found to get things done is to use this technique. Having built-in breaks forces you to step away from your machine and helps prevent burnout that leads to a decrease in code quality and an increase in frustration. 

## Why 'RPG'? This looks like a to-do list.
Eventually I am going to add gamification elements to the app, so you'll earn reward for completing tasks, each 25m will be a "quest", your character grows levels, etc. 

## To-do
- Add gamification elements
- Persistent timers (maybe)
- Replace placeholder graphics
- Clean up display on mobile
- Clean up registration/login screen
